# 🎭 Instagram Ghost Detector

*When Instagram's API said "nope" but you still need to find those digital backstabbers*

## 😤 The Story

5 years ago, I had a beautiful `instaunfollower.py` that used Instagram's API like a civilized human being. Those were simpler times. Then Instagram decided to pull a fast one and basically told everyone: 

> "API? What API? We don't know her 💅"

So here we are in 2025, scraping Instagram like it's 2010, but with **STYLE** ✨

## 🕵️ What This Bad Boy Does

- **Finds the ghosts** 👻 - People who you follow but don't follow you back (the audacity!)
- **Dark mode because we're not animals** 🌙 - Your eyes will thank you
- **Bulk unfollow** 🗑️ - Say goodbye to 50 fake friends at once
- **Retry mechanisms** 🔄 - Because Instagram likes to play hard to get
- **PyAutoGUI fallback** 🎯 - When Selenium gives up, we click manually like a boss

## 🚀 Features That Actually Work

```
✅ Login without crying
✅ Scrape followers/following lists  
✅ Find non-followers (the betrayers)
✅ Mass unfollow with human-like delays
✅ Activity logs with emoji spam
✅ Coordinate detection (AI isn't everything, folks)
✅ Dark theme that doesn't burn your retinas
```

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install selenium chromedriver-autoinstaller pyautogui PyQt5
python instagram_unfollower.py
```

*Note: Chrome required. Firefox users, we don't discriminate, but Chrome is our chosen weapon.*

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This tool is for educational purposes and definitely not for mass unfollowing your ex's friends. Instagram's ToS exists, so use responsibly and don't blame me when you get temp-banned for going ham on the unfollow button.

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- Use `--dev` flag to watch the magic happen in non-headless mode
- Don't unfollow 500 people in 10 minutes (Instagram notices, trust me)
- The tool saves coordinates for faster unfollowing (we're efficient like that)
